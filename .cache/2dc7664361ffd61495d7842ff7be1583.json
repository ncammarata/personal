In particular, I’d wish to\n          express why I think neural network interpretability is important.\n        </p>\n        <H2>Composable Palettes of Abstractions</H2>\n        <p>\n          There are a number of ways to frame neural networks, but the one I\n          find most exciting is a multi-level pattern matcher.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In machine learning, your model is given a task over some data. This\n          task may predicting the future (in say time-series), classification,\n          or simply to deconstruct the data and put it back together correctly.\n          In order to do this, it learns patters and searches for them in the\n          data it is given.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A neural network is composed of several layers (sometimes 100+!) that\n          search for their patterns and forward their `activations` to the next\n          layer. The last layer then uses the activations it gets to make its\n          predictions. Each time it runs all the patterns change to try to\n          improve the predictions the last layer makes.\n        </p>\n        <p>Here are some patterns that a modern image network builds.</p>\n        <img\n          src={require(\"./images/features.png\")}\n          width={\"80%\"}\n          style={{\n            margin: `20px auto`,\n            borderRadius: 5,\n            boxShadow: `1px 1px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`,\n            border: `1px solid white`,\n          }}\n        />\n        <p>\n          You can see that the patterns compose, starting with simple edges,\n          then on to swirls, and eventually specific objects.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Since each layer searches for multiple patterns, it is more analogous\n          to a palette that reports its findings to the next layer.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          src={require(\"./images/palette.png\")}\n          width={\"60%\"}\n          style={{\n            margin: `20px auto`,\n            borderRadius: 5,\n            boxShadow: `1px 1px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`,\n            border: `1px solid white`,\n          }}\n        />\n        <p>\n          Automatic pattern creation and searching has come a long way since\n          Alan Turing wrote that \"Further research into intelligence of\n          machinery will probably be very greatly concerned with ‘searches’ ….\n          [an example] form of search is what I should like to call the\n          ‘cultural search’ … the search for new techniques must be regarded as\n          carried out by the human community as a whole\" in 1948, as well as\n          working on a model similar to a neural network.
