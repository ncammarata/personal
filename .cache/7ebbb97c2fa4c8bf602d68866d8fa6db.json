Both were pretty far outside my\n          expertise, and I convinced myself I wasn't interested in them after\n          they told me repeatedly to go away.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Then one day I saw a job opening at a firm in Boston that looked\n          perfect. They specialized in a technology I love (interactive web\n          applications) and had far too much space in an old factory that they\n          navigated with scooters.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          After writing a way-too-long email and somehow deciding on the\n          cringeful subject line \"I'm really good at jQuery\", I'm eternally\n          grateful that the founders offered me an interview.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          During the in-person interview with the CEO and CTO, I was intensely\n          interested in everything they had to say, because they were the only\n          people I knew in person that could program. The moment I left their\n          office I sat on the sidewalk and transcribed every technology they\n          mentioned.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The most interesting was an open-source graphics library the CTO\n          started. I asked if I could help manage it, and he brushed off my\n          question, saying probably not because it would take a lot of learning.\n        </p>\n        <H2>Give Yourself a Take-Home Project and Perform Magic</H2>\n        <Quote\n          text=\"Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect\"\n          author=\"Teller\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          I interpreted the CTO's \"no\" as a \"yes\", and decided to get a\n          head-start on learning the library by spending all night building a\n          game using it and sent a link to the CTO in the morning along with a\n          thank you note for the interview.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The CTO later told me that this was the deciding factor in me being\n          hired over the other 100+ applicants. I had a lot going against me: my\n          pitch to them involved working on the weekends, and commuting 3h+ a\n          day after school.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          My game was mediocre, but it blew away his expectations of my thank\n          you email. When the CTO showered the next morning, the{\" \"}\n          <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/top.html\">top idea in his mind</a> was\n          wondering how I pulled it off without any contact or library\n          documentation. By the time he got into work and discussed the previous\n          day's interviews with the team, I stood out.\n        </p>\n        <H2>Effort Leverage</H2>\n        <p>\n          Every career guide and grandmother will argue for putting effort into\n          a great career, but I believe there are particularly good points of\n          leverage that most people are not using.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          My game took 13 hours of time and most of it is fun. This is far less\n          time say a college degree (~8,000 hours) and perhaps increased my\n          chance of getting the job by more than a degree would. One way to view\n          this is an investment in the general effort vs specific effort. A\n          degree is a multiplier on the chance of getting any job, but these 13\n          hours is a large multiplier at getting this particular job.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Specific effort doesn't always make sense (for instance, consumer\n          sales), but for objects like jobs where you are looking for one good\n          win, they're often a great and underutilized tool.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Although specific effort can take many forms, I think the particular\n          algorithm of booking the latest interview you can in the day, then\n          staying up all night producing something to include in a thank you\n          letter particularly potent. The reason for the late interview is that\n          you want to have time to work on your specific effort before they meet\n          to discuss whether to hire you. If you're lucky, they'll meet in the\n          morning while still actively thinking about how you pulled off your\n          trick.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Your project can be reading a book about a hero they mentioned and\n          providing one good line of commentary they probably haven't\n          considered. It could be a programming project like I did. Or it could\n          be a thought-through attempt at solving a problem they mentioned\n          within the company.\n        </p>\n        <H2>How Many People Do This?</H2>\n        <p>\n          As far as I can tell this is not common. One company I was part of\n          interviewed hundreds of people for ~30 spots, and only one applicant\n          did something remotely similar. He talked with his interviewer about a\n          particular design problem the company was having with their product.\n          The applicant went home and built a javascript bookmark that when\n          clicked on the live site, redesigned a subset of the site to show his\n          idea of how a feature could work. I wasn't one of the interviewers for\n          his role, but it wasn't long before the entire office heard about his\n          work, and he was hired immediately.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Please <Link to=\"/contact\">let me know</Link> if you have any\n          thoughts, or if this was helpful to you.\n        </p>\n      </post>\n    )\n  }\n\n  styles = {\n    a: {\n      textDecoration: \"underline\",\n      color: `#0084B4`,\n      fontWeight: 600,\n    },\n  }\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"hash":"a59cc33284f7459ffa8feb0233bf3c51","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
