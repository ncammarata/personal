Although neural nets have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of fields, their application in learning causal relations has been scarce. This is due to both a lack of theoretical results connecting risk minimization and causality (enabling function approximators like neural nets to apply), and a lack of scalability in prior causal measures to allow for expressive function approximators like neural nets to apply. In this work, we propose a novel causal measure and algorithm using risk minimization to infer causal relations from time series. We prove that under certain conditions, the positiveness of our measure can deduce a stringent direct structural causality. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalablility of our algorithms to learn nonlinear causal models in synthetic datasets as comparing to other methods, and its effectiveness in inferring causal relations in a video game environment and real-world heart-rate vs. breath-rate and rat brain EEG datasets.\", \"id\": \"B14ejsA5YQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"RETHINKING SELF-DRIVING: MULTI-TASK KNOWLEDGE FOR BETTER GENERALIZATION AND ACCIDENT EXPLANATION ABILITY\", \"abstract\": \"Current end-to-end deep learning driving models have two problems: (1) Poor generalization ability of unobserved driving environment when diversity of training driving dataset is limited (2) Lack of accident explanation ability when driving models don't work as expected.

However, most data signals do not natively exist on a grid, and in the process of being sampled onto a uniform physical grid suffer significant aliasing error and information loss. Moreover, signals can exist in different topological structures as, for example, points, lines, surfaces and volumes. It has been challenging to analyze signals with mixed topologies (for example, point cloud with surface mesh). To this end, we develop mathematical formulations for Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) to directly, and optimally, sample nonuniform data signals of different topologies defined on a simplex mesh into the spectral domain with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is performed in the Euclidean space, which removes the translation ambiguity from works on the graph spectrum. Our representation has four distinct advantages: (1) the process causes no spatial sampling error during initial sampling, (2) the generality of this approach provides a unified framework for using CNNs to analyze signals of mixed topologies, (3) it allows us to leverage state-of-the-art backbone CNN architectures for effective learning without having to design a particular architecture for a particular data structure in an ad-hoc fashion, and (4) the representation allows weighted meshes where each element has a different weight (i.e., texture) indicating local properties.

However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain. Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. Our model also outperforms on USPS to MNIST and synthetic digit to SVHN for high resource unsupervised adaptation. In speech domains, we similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task specific model.

It means that each object is represented by a zero-mean distribution in the space of the activations. We show that such layers can learn surprisingly well, can serve as an efficient exploration tool in reinforcement learning tasks and provide a decent defense against adversarial attacks. We also show that a number of conventional Bayesian neural networks naturally converge to such zero-mean posteriors.

We utilize an architecture that bears resemblance to adversarial autoencoders, but with the data term substituted to be classification loss, which is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence between the generated network parameter distribution with an unknown true parameter distribution. We apply HyperGAN to classification, showing that HyperGAN can learn to generate parameters which solve the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with competitive performance to fully supervised learning, while learning a rich distribution of effective parameters. We also show that HyperGAN can also provide better uncertainty than standard ensembles. This is evaluated by the robustness of HyperGAN-generated ensembles to detect out of distribution data as well as adversarial examples.

The biggest advantage of the PolyCNN is that at each convolutional layer, only one convolutional filter is needed for learning the weights, which we call the seed filter, and all the other convolutional filters are the polynomial transformations of the seed filter, which is termed as an early fan-out. Alternatively, we can also perform late fan-out on the seed filter response to create the number of response maps needed to be input into the next layer. Both early and late fan-out allow the PolyCNN to learn only one convolutional filter at each layer, which can dramatically reduce the model complexity by saving 10� to 50� parameters during learning. While being efficient during both training and testing, the PolyCNN does not suffer performance due to the non-linear polynomial expansion which translates to richer representational power within the convolutional layers. By allowing direct control over model complexity, PolyCNN provides a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. We have verified the on-par performance between the proposed PolyCNN and the standard CNN on several visual datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet.\", \"id\": \"B1GHb2RqYX.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"EXPLICIT RECALL FOR EFFICIENT EXPLORATION\", \"abstract\": \"In this paper, we advocate the use of explicit memory for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning.

We argue that transferring (i.e., translating) said relevant information should involve both discarding source domain-specific information while incorporate target domain-specific information, the latter of which we model with a noisy prior distribution. In order to avoid the degenerate case where the generated samples are only explained by the prior distribution, we propose to minimize an estimate of the mutual information between the generated sample and the sample from the prior distribution. We discover that the architectural choices are an important factor to consider in order to preserve the shared semantic between X and Y .

Biological networks, on the other hand, appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients back to their input neurons, and thus cannot be learning in this way. In response to this, Scellier & Bengio (2017) proposed Equilibrium Propagation - a method for gradient-based training of neural networks which uses only local learning rules and, crucially, does not rely on neurons having a mechanism for back-propagating an error gradient. Equilibrium propagation, however, has a major practical limitation: inference involves doing an iterative optimization of neural activations to find a fixed-point, and the number of steps required to closely approximate this fixed point scales poorly with the depth of the network. In response to this problem, we propose Initialized Equilibrium Propagation, which trains a feedforward network to initialize the iterative inference procedure for Equilibrium propagation. This feed-forward network learns to approximate the state of the fixed-point using a local learning rule. After training, we can simply use this initializing network for inference, resulting in a learned feedforward network. Our experiments show that this network appears to work as well or better than the original version of Equilibrium propagation. This shows how we might go about training deep networks without using backpropagation.\", \"id\": \"B1GMDsR5tm.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: FROM TEMPORAL TO\", \"abstract\": \"Value function, lying in the heart of reinforcement learning (RL), is defined as expected total reward to capture the long-term dependency between current state/action and delayed reward. Following this definition, it's natural to derive a temporal decomposition for value function as a sum of discounted reward on different time steps. Most existing RL algorithms estimate value function based on this temporal decomposition. Apart of traditional temporal decomposition, in this paper, we explore a novel spatial decomposition for value function. In our formulation, value function Q(s, a) is a weighted sum of reward R(s ), and the corresponding weight is defined as the discounted visiting frequency d(s, a, s ). Here, d(s, a, s ) is the key part that captures long-term dependency between current state/action (s/a) with future state s . This formulation inspires us to study d(s, a, s ) in depth, with function approximation as usual. Under the function approximation setting, the estimation of d(s, a, s ) can benefit from enhanced generalization between similar future state s , which thus results in a better estimation for Q(s, a). Accordingly, we propose spatial monte-carlo (SMC) method, and apply the idea of SMC to actor-critic algorithms with m-step advantage estimation and GAE.

During training, the geometry enforced on one batch of features is simultaneously validated on a separate batch using a validation loss consistent with the geometry. We study a particular case of GRSVNet, the Orthogonal-Low-rank Embedding (OLE)-GRSVNet, which is capable of producing highly discriminative features residing in orthogonal low-rank subspaces. Numerical experiments show that OLE-GRSVNet outperforms DNNs with conventional regularization when trained on real data.

First, we show that dropout can be explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation. Based on this explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, gradient acceleration in activation function (GAAF), that accelerates gradients to flow even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model converges on a flat region.

In this work, we approximate the number of linear regions of specific rectifier networks with an algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds of mixed-integer linear sets. In addition, we present a tighter upper bound that leverages network coefficients. We test both on trained networks. The algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds is several orders of magnitude faster than exact counting and the values reach similar orders of magnitude, hence making our approach a viable method to compare the expressiveness of such networks.

To achieve this, the proposed algorithm generalises the Q-, value and advantage functions for data from multiple policies. The method uses trust region optimisation, while avoiding some of the common problems of the algorithms such as TRPO or ACKTR: it uses hyperparameters to replace the trust region selection heuristics, as well as the trainable covariance matrix instead of the fixed one.

(2016) are input-dependent, small, pixel-wise perturbations, and they give different attack directions for different inputs. On the other hand, universal adversarial attacks are input-agnostic and the same attack works for most inputs. Translation or rotation-equivariant neural network models provide one approach to prevent universal attacks based on simple geometric transformations. In this paper, we observe an interesting spectral property shared by all of the above input-dependent, pixel-wise adversarial attacks on translation and rotation-equivariant networks. We exploit this property to get a single universal attack direction that fools the model on most inputs. Moreover, we show how to compute this universal attack direction using principal components of the existing input-dependent attacks on a very small sample of test inputs.

To overcome this limitation, we directly incorporate uncertainty over the value (Q) function. Further, we only introduce randomness in the last layer (i.e. the output layer) of the DQN and use independent Gaussian priors on the weights. This allows us to efficiently carry out Thompson sampling through Gaussian sampling and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), which has fast closed-form updates.

To mitigate this problem we propose Sparse Binary Compression (SBC), a compression framework that allows for a drastic reduction of communication cost for distributed training. SBC combines existing techniques of communication delay and gradient sparsification with a novel binarization method and optimal weight update encoding to push compression gains to new limits. By doing so, our method also allows us to smoothly trade-off gradient sparsity and temporal sparsity to adapt to the requirements of the learning task. Our experiments show, that SBC can reduce the upstream communication on a variety of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures by more than four orders of magnitude without significantly harming the convergence speed in terms of forward-backward passes. For instance, we can train ResNet50 on ImageNet in the same number of iterations to the baseline accuracy, using �3531 less bits or train it to a 1% lower accuracy using �37208 less bits.

Answering this question may help us qualitatively understand the dynamics of deep neural network optimization. We show evidence through qualitative and quantitative experiments that mini-batch SGD rarely crosses barriers during DNN optimization. As we show, the mini-batch induced noise helps SGD explore different regions of the loss surface using a seemingly different mechanism. To complement this finding, we also investigate the qualitative reason behind the slowing down of this exploration when using larger batch-sizes.

Moreover, we find that rewarding influence can lead agents to develop emergent communication protocols. Therefore, we also employ influence to train agents to use an explicit communication channel, and find that it leads to more effective communication and higher collective reward. Finally, we show that influence can be computed by equipping each agent with an internal model that predicts the actions of other agents.

In this work, we study how an unsupervised exploration phase can be used to build up such prior knowledge, which can then be utilized in a second phase to perform new tasks, either directly without any additional exploration, or through minimal fine-tuning. A critical question with this approach is: what kind of knowledge should be transferred from the unsupervised phase to the goal-directed phase? We argue that model-based RL offers an appealing solution. By transferring models, which are task-agnostic, we can perform new tasks without any additional learning at all. However, this relies on having a suitable exploration method during unsupervised training, and a model-based RL method that can effectively utilize modern high-capacity parametric function classes, such as deep neural networks. We show that both challenges can be addressed by representing model-uncertainty, which can both guide exploration in the unsupervised phase and ensure that the errors in the model are not exploited by the planner in the goal-directed phase.

In a linear model (i.e., g(x) = wx + b), the gradient corresponds solely to the weights w. Such a model can reasonably locally linearly approximate a smooth nonlinear DNN, and hence the weights of this local model are the gradient. The other part, however, of a local linear model, i.e., the bias b, is usually overlooked in attribution methods since it is not part of the gradient. In this paper, we observe that since the bias in a DNN also has a non-negligible contribution to the correctness of predictions, it can also play a significant role in understanding DNN behaviors. In particular, we study how to attribute a DNN's bias to its input features. We propose a backpropagation-type algorithm \\\"bias back-propagation (BBp)\\\" that starts at the output layer and iteratively attributes the bias of each layer to its input nodes as well as combining the resulting bias term of the previous layer. This process stops at the input layer, where summing up the attributions over all the input features exactly recovers b. Together with the backpropagation of the gradient generating w, we can fully recover the locally linear model g(x) = wx + b. Hence, the attribution of the DNN outputs to its inputs is decomposed into two parts, the gradient w and the bias attribution, providing separate and complementary explanations. We study several possible attribution methods applied to the bias of each layer in BBp .

Here we ask, as ANNs have continued to evolve in performance, are they also strong candidate models for the brain? To answer this question, we developed Brain-Score, a composite of neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how brainlike it is, together with an online platform where ANNs can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models. Deploying our framework on dozens of state-of-the-art ANNs, we found that ResNet and DenseNet families of models are the closest models from the Machine Learning community to primate ventral visual stream. Curiously, best current ImageNet models, such as PNASNet, were not the top-performing models on Brain-Score.

To address this concern, prior works either add noise to the data or send features extracted from the raw data. They struggle to balance between the utility and privacy because added noise reduces utility and raw data can be reconstructed from extracted features. This work represents a methodical departure from prior works: we balance between a measure of privacy and another of utility by leveraging adversarial learning to find a sweeter tradeoff. We design an encoder that optimizes against the reconstruction error (a measure of privacy), adversarially by a Decoder, and the inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by a Classifier. The result is RAN, a novel deep model with a new training algorithm that automatically extracts features for classification that are both private and useful. It turns out that adversarially forcing the extracted features to only conveys the intended information required by classification leads to an implicit regularization leading to better classification accuracy than the original model which completely ignores privacy.

In standard neural networks used for deep learning, attackers can craft adversarial examples from most input to cause a misclassification of their choice. We introduce a new type of network units, called RBFI units, whose non-linear structure makes them inherently resistant to adversarial attacks. On permutationinvariant MNIST, in absence of adversarial attacks, networks using RBFI units match the performance of networks using sigmoid units, and are slightly below the accuracy of networks with ReLU units. When subjected to adversarial attacks, networks with RBFI units retain accuracies above 93% for projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks that degrade the accuracy of networks with ReLU or sigmoid units to below 70%. Considering a variety of attack mechanisms, RBFI networks trained on regular input either exceed or closely match the accuracy of sigmoid and ReLU network trained with the help of adversarial examples.

In this work, we perform an empirical study of the behavior of the beam search algorithm across three sequence synthesis tasks. We find that increasing the beam width leads to sequences that are disproportionately based on early and highly non-greedy decisions. These sequences typically include a very low probability token that is followed by a sequence of tokens with higher (conditional) probability leading to an overall higher probability sequence. However, as beam width increases, such sequences are more likely to have a lower evaluation score.

We introduce Curiosity Search for deep reinforcement learning, or Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which encourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many different states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma's Revenge. We further show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and Tutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS also doubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to benefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already easily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a maximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest--higher than any methods other than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and dense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an interesting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates further research into hybridizing across-training and intra-life exploration methods.\", \"id\": \"BkeDEoCctQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"THE NONLINEARITY COEFFICIENT - PREDICTING GENERALIZATION IN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"For a long time, designing neural architectures that exhibit high performance was considered a dark art that required expert hand-tuning. One of the few well-known guidelines for architecture design is the avoidance of exploding or vanishing gradients. However, even this guideline has remained relatively vague and circumstantial, because there exists no well-defined, gradient-based metric that can be computed before training begins and can robustly predict the performance of the network after training is complete. We introduce what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such metric: the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC). Via an extensive empirical study, we show that the NLC, computed in the network's randomly initialized state, is a powerful predictor of test error and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error, at least in fully-connected feedforward networks. The NLC is also conceptually simple, cheap to compute, and is robust to a range of confounders and architectural design choices that comparable metrics are not necessarily robust to. Hence, we argue the NLC is an important tool for architecture search and design, as it can robustly predict poor training outcomes before training even begins.\", \"id\": \"BkeK-nRcFX.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"CRITICAL LEARNING PERIODS IN DEEP NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"Similar to humans and animals, deep artificial neural networks exhibit critical periods during which a temporary stimulus deficit can impair the development of a skill. The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and length of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can be overcome with further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity between layers of a network during training. Counterintuitively, information raises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss of \\\"Information Plasticity\\\". Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training. These findings suggest that the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process. Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning. Finally, critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information processing.\", \"id\": \"BkeStsCcKQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"COMBINING GLOBAL SPARSE GRADIENTS WITH LOCAL GRADIENTS\", \"abstract\": \"Data-parallel neural network training is network-intensive, so gradient dropping was designed to exchange only large gradients.

In this work, we introduce bLock-wise Intermediate representation Training (LIT), a novel model compression technique that extends the use of intermediate representations in deep network compression, outperforming KD and hint training. LIT has two key ideas: 1) LIT trains a student of the same width (but shallower depth) as the teacher by directly comparing the intermediate representations, and 2) LIT uses the intermediate representation from the previous block in the teacher model as an input to the current student block during training, avoiding unstable intermediate representations in the student network. We show that LIT provides substantial reductions in network depth without loss in accuracy -- for example, LIT can compress a ResNeXt-110 to a ResNeXt-20 (5.5�) on CIFAR10 and a VDCNN-29 to a VDCNN-9 (3.2�) on Amazon Reviews without loss in accuracy, outperforming KD and hint training in network size for a given accuracy.

Specifically, we consider a highly constrained adversary that (i) has partial observability into the model parameter space due to lack of knowledge of other agents' updates; (ii) operates in an environment where training data are i.i.d. between the agents (hence spurious updates will easily standout among benign ones); and (iii) has its single malicious update (mostly) cancelled by multiple benign updates. For this highly constrained adversary, we propose a sequence of model poisoning strategies that starting with malicious update boosting, incrementally introduce various forms of regularization, followed by parameter estimation to improve on both attack success and stealth. For each strategy, we analyze its impact on the model parameter space, design possible detection approaches and incorporate the insights for gaining stealth. Finally, we use a suite of interpretability techniques to generate visual explanations of the decision boundary and internal feature representations of a benign and malicious model and show that the explanations are nearly visually indistinguishable.

After identifying this excessive invariance, we propose the usage of bijective deep networks to enable access to all variations. We introduce metameric sampling as an analytic attack for these networks, requiring no optimization, and show that it uncovers large subspaces of misclassified inputs. Then we apply these networks to MNIST and ImageNet and show that one can manipulate the class-specific content of almost any image without changing the hidden activations.

In this study, we revisit their hypothesis, considering units with selectivity for lower-level features, and argue that selective units are not always harmful to the network performance. Specifically, by using DNNs trained for image classification, we analyzed the orientation selectivity of individual units. Orientation selectivity is a low-level selectivity widely studied in visual neuroscience, in which, when images of bars with several orientations are presented to the eye, many neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to a specific orientation. We found that orientation-selective units exist in both lower and higher layers of DNNs, as in our brain. In particular, units in the lower layers become more orientation-selective as the generalization performance improves during the course of training of the DNNs. Consistently, networks that generalize better are more orientation-selective in the lower layers. We finally reveal that ablating these selective units in the lower layers substantially degrades the generalization performance. These results suggest to the machinelearning community that, contrary to the triviality of units with high-level selectivity, lower-layer units with selectivity for low-level features are indispensable for generalization, and for neuroscientists, orientation selectivity does play a causally important role in object recognition.\", \"id\": \"Bkx_Dj09tQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"SELFLESS SEQUENTIAL LEARNING\", \"abstract\": \"Sequential learning studies the problem of learning tasks in a sequence with access restricted to only the data of the current task.

In this paper we examine this question systematically by proposing a knowledge extraction method using M-of-N rules which allows us to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules describing hidden features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments reported in this paper show that the shape of this landscape reveals an optimal trade off between comprehensibility and accuracy, showing that each latent variable has an optimal M-of-N rule to describe its behaviour.

Considered as a hallmark of human intelligence, the community has recently witnessed several contributions on this topic, in particular through meta-learning, where a model learns how to learn an effective model for few-shot learning. The main idea is to acquire prior knowledge from a set of training tasks, which is then used to perform (few-shot) test tasks. Most existing work assumes that both training and test tasks are drawn from the same distribution, and a large amount of labeled data is available in the training tasks. This is a very strong assumption which restricts the usage of meta-learning strategies in the real world where ample training tasks following the same distribution as test tasks may not be available. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning paradigm wherein a few-shot learning model is learnt, which simultaneously overcomes domain shift between the train and test tasks via adversarial domain adaptation.

On the other hand, networks without downsampling do not memorize training data. We provide further evidence that the same effect happens in nonlinear networks. Moreover, downsampling in nonlinear networks causes the model to not only memorize just linear combinations of images, but individual training images.

To enable more meaningful comparisons, we identified three distinct continual learning scenarios based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class probabilities as \\\"soft targets\\\") achieved superior performance in all three scenarios. In addition, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback connections.

Unlike the existing methods on domain transfer through deep generative models, such as CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017a) and StarGAN (Choi et al., 2017), the variational domain adaptation has three advantages. Firstly, the samples from the target are not required. Instead, the framework requries one known source as a prior p(x) and binary discriminators, p(Di|x), discriminating the target domain Di from others. Consequently, the framework regards a target as a posterior that can be explicitly formulated through the Bayesian inference, p(x|Di)  p(Di|x)p(x), as exhibited by a further proposed model of multi-domain variational autoencoder (MD-VAE). Secondly, the framework is scablable to large-scale domains. MDVAE sophisticatedly puts together all the domains as well as the samples drawn from the prior into normal distributions in the same latent space as embeddings. The model enables us to expand the method to uncountable infinite domains such as continuous domains as well as interpolation. Thirdly, with MD-VAE, no need to search hyperparameter anymore. Although several domain transfer based on adversarial learning need sophisticated automatic/manual hyperparameter search, MD-VAE fast converges with less tuning because it has only one trainable matrix in addition to VAE.

Through investigating this general optimization dynamics, we analyze the behavior of SGD on escaping from minima and its regularization effects. A novel indicator is derived to characterize the efficiency of escaping from minima through measuring the alignment of noise covariance and the curvature of loss function. Based on this indicator, two conditions are established to show which type of noise structure is superior to isotropic noise in term of escaping efficiency. We further show that the anisotropic noise in SGD satisfies the two conditions, and thus helps to escape from sharp and poor minima effectively, towards more stable and flat minima that typically generalize well. We verify our understanding through comparing this anisotropic diffusion with full gradient descent plus isotropic diffusion (i.e. Langevin dynamics) and other types of position-dependent noise.\", \"id\": \"H1M7soActX.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"UNICORN: CONTINUAL LEARNING WITH A UNIVERSAL, OFF-POLICY AGENT\", \"abstract\": \"Some real-world domains are best characterized as a single task, but for others this perspective is limiting.

Performing design exploration to find the best NN for a particular task often requires extensive training with different models on a large dataset, which is very computationally expensive. The most straightforward method to accelerate this computation is to distribute the batch of SGD over multiple processors. To keep the distributed processors fully utilized requires commensurately growing the batch size; however, large batch training often times leads to degradation in accuracy, poor generalization, and even poor robustness to adversarial attacks. Existing solutions for large batch training either significantly degrade accuracy or require massive hyper-parameter tuning. To address this issue, we propose a novel large batch training method which combines recent results in adversarial training (to regularize against \\\"sharp minima\\\") and second order optimization (to use curvature information to change batch size adaptively during training). We extensively evaluate our method on Cifar-10/100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet datasets, using multiple NNs, including residual networks as well as smaller networks for mobile applications such as SqueezeNext.

In this paper, we propose a novel asynchronous distributed algorithm that tackles this limitation by well-thought-out averaging of model updates, computed by workers. The algorithm allows computing gradients along the process of gradient merge, thus, reducing or even completely eliminating worker idle time due to communication overhead, which is a pitfall of existing asynchronous methods. We provide theoretical analysis of the proposed asynchronous algorithm, and show its regret bounds. According to our analysis, the crucial parameter for keeping high convergence rate is the maximal discrepancy between local parameter vectors of any pair of workers. As long as it is kept relatively small, the convergence rate of the algorithm is shown to be the same as the one of a sequential online learning. Furthermore, in our algorithm, this discrepancy is bounded by an expression that involves the staleness parameter of the algorithm, and is independent on the number of workers. This is the main differentiator between our approach and other solutions, such as Elastic Asynchronous SGD or Downpour SGD, in which that maximal discrepancy is bounded by an expression that depends on the number of workers, due to gradient delay problem. To demonstrate effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a series of experiments on image classification task on a cluster with 4 machines, equipped with a commodity communication switch and with a single GPU card per machine. Our experiments show a linear scaling on 4-machine cluster without sacrificing the test accuracy, while eliminating almost completely worker idle time.

Loss terms are used to ensure that all training samples x are a local maxima, according to h and satisfy c(x) = 1. Therefore, c and h provide training signals to each other: a point x in the vicinity of x satisfies c(x) = -1 or is deemed by h to be lower in value than x. We present an algorithm, show an example where it is more efficient to use local maxima as an indicator function than to employ conventional classification, and derive a suitable generalization bound.

However, a baseline term that serves as a control variate for reducing variance is currently provided only for first order gradient estimation, limiting the utility of higher-order gradient estimates. To improve the sample efficiency of DiCE, we propose a new baseline term for higher order gradient estimation.

Importantly it reuses the same baseline function (e.g. the state-value function in reinforcement learning) already used for the first order baseline. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations of our baseline term, which demonstrate that it can dramatically reduce the variance of second order gradient estimators produced by DiCE.

One plausible explanation is that non-convex neural network training procedures are better suited to the use of fundamentally different learning rate schedules, such as the \\\"cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs\\\" method (which more closely resembles an exponentially decaying learning rate schedule); note that this widely used schedule is in stark contrast to the polynomial decay schemes prescribed in the stochastic approximation literature, which are indeed shown to be (worst case) optimal for classes of convex optimization problems. The main contribution of this work shows that the picture is far more nuanced, where we do not even need to move to non-convex optimization to show other learning rate schemes can be far more effective. In fact, even for the simple case of stochastic linear regression with a fixed time horizon, the rate achieved by any polynomial decay scheme is suboptimal compared to the statistical minimax rate (by a factor of condition number); in contrast the \\\"cut the learning rate every constant number of epochs\\\" provides an exponential improvement (depending only logarithmically on the condition number) compared to any polynomial decay scheme.

As a first step towards relieving this annotation burden, we propose the problem of guided segmentation: given varying amounts of pixel-wise labels, segment unannotated pixels by propagating supervision locally (within an image) and non-locally (across images). We propose guided networks, which extract a latent task representation-- guidance--from variable amounts and classes (categories, instances, etc.) of pixel supervision and optimize our architecture end-to-end for fast, accurate, and dataefficient segmentation by meta-learning. To span the few-shot and many-shot learning regimes, we examine guidance from as little as one pixel per concept to as much as 1000+ images, and compare to full gradient optimization at both extremes. To explore generalization, we analyze guidance as a bridge between different levels of supervision to segment classes as the union of instances.

However, despite the importance of understanding the learning dynamics of DNNs, properties of easy and hard examples are not fully investigated. In this paper, we study the similarities of easy and hard examples respectively among different CNNs, assessing those examples contributions to generalization. Our results show that most easy examples are identical among different CNNs, as they share similar dataset-dependent patterns (e.g., colors, structures, and superficial cues in high-frequency). Moreover, while hard examples tend to contribute more to generalization than easy examples, removing a large number of easy examples leads to poor generalization, and we find that most misclassified examples in validation dataset are hard examples.

One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4) Pooling confers too much deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to counteract this inductive bias.

To annotate examples corpora for multiclass classification, we might need to ask multiple yes/no questions, exploiting a label hierarchy if one is available. To address this more realistic setting, we propose active learning with partial feedback (ALPF), where the learner must actively choose both which example to label and which binary question to ask. At each step, the learner selects an example, asking if it belongs to a chosen (possibly composite) class. Each answer eliminates some classes, leaving the learner with a partial label. The learner may then either ask more questions about the same example (until an exact label is uncovered) or move on immediately, leaving the first example partially labeled. Active learning with partial labels requires (i) a sampling strategy to choose (example, class) pairs, and (ii) learning from partial labels between rounds. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our most effective method improves 26% (relative) in top-1 classification accuracy compared to i.i.d. baselines and standard active learners given 30% of the annotation budget that would be required (naively) to annotate the dataset.

We find that it is necessary to use margin distributions at multiple layers of a deep network. On the CIFAR-10 and the CIFAR-100 datasets, our proposed measure correlates very strongly with the generalization gap. In addition, we find the following other factors to be of importance: normalizing margin values for scale independence, using characterizations of margin distribution rather than just the margin (closest distance to decision boundary), and working in log space instead of linear space (effectively using a product of margins rather than a sum).

Interaction with the environment allows humans to carry out experiments: taking actions that help uncover true casual relationships which in turn can be used for building better dynamics models. Analogously, we would expect such interaction to be helpful for a learning agent while it learns to model the dynamics of the environment. In this paper, we build upon this intuition, by using an auxiliary cost function to ensure consistency between what the agent observes (by actually performing actions in the real world) and what it hallucinates (by imagining to have taken actions in the environment).

Here we consider learning both an energy function and an efficient approximate sampling mechanism for the corresponding distribution. Whereas the critic (or discriminator) in generative adversarial networks (GANs) learns to separate data and generator samples, introducing an entropy maximization regularizer on the generator can turn the interpretation of the critic into an energy function, which separates the training distribution from everything else, and thus can be used for tasks like anomaly or novelty detection. This paper is motivated by the older idea of sampling in latent space rather than data space because running a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) in latent space has been found to be easier and more efficient, and because a GAN-like generator can convert latent space samples to data space samples. For this purpose, we show how a Markov chain can be run in latent space whose samples can be mapped to data space, producing better samples. These samples are also used for the negative phase gradient required to estimate the log-likelihood gradient of the data space energy function. To maximize entropy at the output of the generator, we take advantage of recently introduced neural estimators of mutual information.

So far, the most successful defenses generate adversarial examples during each training step and add them to the training data. Yet, this brings significant computational overhead. In this paper, we investigate defenses against adversarial attacks. First, we propose feature smoothing, a simple data augmentation method with little computational overhead. Essentially, feature smoothing trains a neural network on virtual training data as an interpolation of features from a pair of samples, with the new label remaining the same as the dominant data point. The intuition behind feature smoothing is to generate virtual data points as close as adversarial examples, and to avoid the computational burden of generating data during training. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets explore different combinations of known regularization and data augmentation methods and show that feature smoothing with logit squeezing performs best for both adversarial and clean accuracy. Second, we propose an unified framework to understand the connections and differences among different efficient methods by analyzing the biases and variances of decision boundary.

However, most of the times the nodes are unlabeled or their labels (or the given feature vectors of the nodes) provide no information about the similarity between the nodes and the locations of the nodes in the graph. Accordingly, message passing may not propagate helpful information throughout the graph. We show that this conventional approach can fail to learn to solve even simple graph classification tasks. We alleviate this serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them a two step method where in the second step, the message passing block is given the continuous features obtained by the embedding algorithm in the first step.

We prove that MLIPS is asymptotically unbiased, and moreover, has a smaller nonasymptotic mean squared error than IPS. Such an error reduction phenomenon is somewhat surprising as the estimated surrogate policy is less accurate than the given historical policy. Results on multi-label classification problems and a large-scale ad placement dataset demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of MLIPS. Furthermore, the proposed surrogate policy technique is complementary to existing error reduction techniques, and when combined, is able to consistently boost the performance of several widely used approaches.\", \"id\": \"HklKui0ct7.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"OVERLAPPING COMMUNITY DETECTION WITH GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"Community detection in graphs is of central importance in graph mining, machine learning and network science.

Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true I(X; T ) over these networks is provably either constant (discrete X) or infinite (continuous X). This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which I(X; T ) is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a rigorous estimator for I(X; T ) in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models.

Though GAN has led to significant improvements in the data representations, it still has several problems such as unstable training, hidden manifold of data, and huge computational overhead. GAN tends to produce the data simply without any information about the manifold of the data, which hinders from controlling desired features to generate. Moreover, most of GAN's have a large size of manifold, resulting in poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN to control the latent semantic representation, called LSC-GAN, which allows us to produce desired data to generate and learns a representation of the data efficiently. Unlike the conventional GAN models with hidden distribution of latent space, we define the distributions explicitly in advance that are trained to generate the data based on the corresponding features by inputting the latent variables that follow the distribution. As the larger scale of latent space caused by deploying various distributions in one latent space makes training unstable while maintaining the dimension of latent space, we need to separate the process of defining the distributions explicitly and operation of generation. We prove that a VAE is proper for the former and modify a loss function of VAE to map the data into the pre-defined latent space so as to locate the reconstructed data as close to the input data according to its characteristics. Moreover, we add the KL divergence to the loss function of LSC-GAN to include this process. The decoder of VAE, which generates the data with the corresponding features from the pre-defined latent space, is used as the generator of the LSC-GAN. Several experiments on the CelebA dataset are conducted to verify the usefulness of the proposed method to generate desired data stably and efficiently, achieving a high compression ratio that can hold about 24 pixels of information in each dimension of latent space.

The core idea is to introduce sequential information, so that an agent can refer to both the current state and past state-action pairs to make a decision. We formulate our approach into a recurrent model, and instantiate it using LSTM so as to fuse both long-term and short-term information. SIMILE is a generalized IL framework which is easily applied to BL and IRL, two major types of IL algorithms. Experiments are performed on several robot controlling tasks in OpenAI Gym. SIMILE not only achieves performance gain over the baseline approaches, but also enjoys the benefit of faster convergence and better stability of testing performance. These advantages verify a higher learning efficiency of SIMILE, and implies its potential applications in real-world scenarios, i.e., when the agent-environment interaction is more difficult and/or expensive.\", \"id\": \"Hyghb2Rct7.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"IMPROVING MMD-GAN TRAINING WITH REPULSIVE LOSS FUNCTION\", \"abstract\": \"Generative adversarial nets (GANs) are widely used to learn the data sampling process and their performance heavily depends on the loss functions used in training.

We then apply our general framework in a setup where we assume that the pre-activation values of the network are not too small (although we assume this only on the training data).

While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents. The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow. We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models. To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow. We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.

The deployed DNN is either leveraged in a white-box setting (model internals are publicly known) or a black-box setting (only model outputs are known) depending on the application. A practical concern in the rush to adopt DNNs is protecting the models against Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. We propose BlackMarks, the first endto-end multi-bit watermarking framework that is applicable in the black-box scenario. BlackMarks takes the pre-trained unmarked model and the owner's binary signature as inputs. The output is the corresponding marked model with specific keys that can be later used to trigger the embedded watermark. To do so, BlackMarks first designs a model-dependent encoding scheme that maps all possible classes in the task to bit `0' and bit `1'. Given the owner's watermark signature (a binary string), a set of key image and label pairs is designed using targeted adversarial attacks. The watermark (WM) is then encoded in the distribution of output activations of the DNN by fine-tuning the model with a WM-specific regularized loss. To extract the WM, BlackMarks queries the model with the WM key images and decodes the owner's signature from the corresponding predictions using the designed encoding scheme. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of BlackMarks' performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet datasets and corroborate its effectiveness and robustness.

Parametric generalisation relies on the interpolation power of a function approximator that is given the task description as input; one of its most common form are universal value function approximators (UVFAs). Another way to generalise to new tasks is to exploit structure in the RL problem itself. Generalised policy improvement (GPI) combines solutions of previous tasks into a policy for the unseen task; this relies on instantaneous policy evaluation of old policies under the new reward function, which is made possible through successor features (SFs).

Subsidiary information refers to the factors that might decrease the performance of the primary model such as channel information in speaker recognition and noise information in digit recognition. Our proposed framework comprises two discriminative models for the primary and subsidiary task, as well as an encoder network for feature representation.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) methods attempt to address this scalability issue by learning action selection policies at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. Abstraction can be had by identifying a relatively small set of states that are likely to be useful as subgoals, in concert with the learning of corresponding skill policies to achieve those subgoals. Many approaches to subgoal discovery in HRL depend on the analysis of a model of the environment, but the need to learn such a model introduces its own problems of scale. Once subgoals are identified, skills may be learned through intrinsic motivation, introducing an internal reward signal marking subgoal attainment. In this paper, we present a novel model-free method for subgoal discovery using incremental unsupervised learning over a small memory of the most recent experiences of the agent. When combined with an intrinsic motivation learning mechanism, this method learns subgoals and skills together, based on experiences in the environment. Thus, we offer an original approach to HRL that does not require the acquisition of a model of the environment, suitable for large-scale applications.

Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarial trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution. Our discovery of such sensitivity on data distribution is based on a study which disentangles the behaviors of clean accuracy and robust accuracy of the Bayes classifier. Further empirical investigation on MNIST and CIFAR10 confirms our finding that numerous MNIST and CIFAR10 variants achieve comparable clean accuracies in various different neural nets under standard training but significantly different robustness under adversarial training. This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves.

In this paper, we demonstrate that such drops in accuracy due to changes of the visible region are a common phenomenon between humans and existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), and are much more prominent in DNNs. We found many cases where DNNs classified one region correctly and the other incorrectly, though they only differed by one row or column of pixels, and were often bigger than the average human minimal image size. We show that this phenomenon is independent from previous works that have reported lack of invariance to minor modifications in object location in DNNs. Our results thus reveal a new failure mode of DNNs that also affects humans to a much lesser degree.

When the property can be violated, our approach provides an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable.

In this work, we show that this sensitivity and the poor performance of classification models (relative to humans) on noisy images are two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon. Nearby errors simply lie on the boundary of a large set of errors whose volume can be measured using test error in additive noise. We present compelling new evidence in favor of this interpretation before discussing some preexisting results which also support our perspective. The relationship between nearby errors and failure to generalize in noise has implications for the adversarial defense literature, as it suggests that defenses which fail to reduce test error in noise will also fail to defend against small adversarial perturbations.

Neural representations vary drastically across the first stages of visual processing. At the output of the retina, receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure, whereas in the primary visual cortex (V1), typical RFs are sharply tuned to a precise orientation. Moreover, there are striking differences in early visual representations across species. Specifically, the retinas of small vertebrates (e.g. salamander, mouse) perform sophisticated non-linear computations extracting features directly relevant to behavior. In contrast, the dominant retinal cell types in primates encode the visual scene quasi-linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. There is currently no theory explaining these differences in representation across layers and across species. Here, using a deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we show that such differences in representation emerge as a direct consequence of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and brain networks. Whereas previous studies of efficient coding invoked inconsistent sets of metabolic constraints to account for the differences in RF shapes found in the retina and V1, we find a unique model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint of this model is a reduced number of neurons at the retinal output, a constraint consistent with the anatomy of the optic nerve. Furthermore, we find that retinal neurons in our model emerge as non-linear and lossy feature detectors for small brain networks, whereas they emerge as linear and faithful encoders of the visual scene for large brains. Our results thus reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina as either performing feature extraction or efficient compression of natural scenes, by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two objectives, depending on the neural resources allocated to their visual system.\", \"id\": \"S1xq3oR5tQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"IMPROVING SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE LEARNING VIA OPTIMAL TRANSPORT\", \"abstract\": \"Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

We present explicit architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We then describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate, at least partially, with the sanitization process.

We find that a network of leaky-integrate-andfire neurons with fixed random, localized receptive fields in the hidden layer and spike timing dependent plasticity to train the readout layer achieves 98.1% test accuracy on MNIST, which is close to the optimal result achievable with errorbackpropagation in non-convolutional networks of rate neurons with one hidden layer.

However, in the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) control, requiring an agent to make mistakes, or even allowing mistakes, can be quite dangerous and costly in the real world. For this reason, AV RL is generally only viable in simulation. Because these simulations have imperfect representations, particularly with respect to graphics, physics, and human interaction, we find motivation for a framework similar to RL, suitable to the real world. To this end, we formulate a learning framework that learns from restricted exploration by having a human demonstrator do the exploration. Existing work on learning from demonstration typically either assumes the collected data is performed by an optimal expert, or requires potentially dangerous exploration to find the optimal policy. We propose an alternative framework that learns continuous control from only safe behavior. One of our key insights is that the problem becomes tractable if the feedback score that rates the demonstration applies to the atomic action, as opposed to the entire sequence of actions. We use human experts to collect driving data as well as to label the driving data through a framework we call \\\"Backseat Driver\\\", giving us state-action pairs matched with scalar values representing the score for the action. We call the more general learning framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given negative as well as positive examples.

Such bonus is summed up with the real task reward -- making it possible for RL algorithms to learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation from those in memory -- which incorporates rich information about environment dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known \\\"couch-potato\\\" issues of prior work -- when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions which lead to unpredictable consequences. We test our approach in visually rich 3D environments in VizDoom and DMLab. In VizDoom, our agent learns to successfully navigate to a distant goal at least 2 times faster than the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM. In DMLab, our agent generalizes well to new procedurally generated levels of the game -- reaching the goal at least 2 times more frequently than ICM on test mazes with very sparse reward.\", \"id\": \"SkeK3s0qKQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"REPRESENTATION COMPRESSION AND GENERALIZATION IN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"Understanding the groundbreaking performance of Deep Neural Networks is one of the greatest challenges to the scientific community today.

Specifically, we show that the training of the network is characterized by a rapid increase in the mutual information (MI) between the layers and the target label, followed by a longer decrease in the MI between the layers and the input variable. Further, we explicitly show that these two fundamental information-theoretic quantities correspond to the generalization error of the network, as a result of introducing a new generalization bound that is exponential in the representation compression. The analysis focuses on typical patterns of large-scale problems. For this purpose, we introduce a novel analytic bound on the mutual information between consecutive layers in the network.

The primary challenge of the analysis is the fact that some parameters are updated by gradient while others are not. The convergence analysis applies to any activation function that satisfies our common assumptions. For the analysis, we also show the sufficient and necessary conditions for the stepsizes and diminishing weights to ensure the convergence. In the numerical experiments, we use more complex models with more layers and ReLU activation.

While there has been major advances over the years, most of these successes have been demonstrated in either video games or simulation environments. This is primarily because the rewards (even the intrinsic ones) are non-differentiable since they are function of the environment (which is a black-box). In this paper, we focus on the policy optimization aspect of the intrinsic reward function. Specifically, by using a local approximation, we formulate intrinsic reward as a differentiable function so as to perform policy optimization using likelihood maximization � much like supervised learning instead of reinforcement learning. This leads to a significantly sample efficient exploration policy. Our experiments clearly show that our approach outperforms both on-policy and off-policy optimization approaches like REINFORCE and DQN respectively. But most importantly, we are able to implement an exploration policy on a robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch just using data collected via the differentiable exploration module.

The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60, 000 MNIST training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few steps of gradient descent, given a particular fixed network initialization.

Cross-domain Generative Adversarial Networks were reported to achieve exciting results in image processing applications. However, in the domain of materials science, there is a need to synthesize data with higher order complexity compared to observed samples, and the state-of-the-art crossdomain GANs can not be adapted directly.

However, standard data augmentation is essentially a brute-force strategy which is inefficient, as it performs all the pre-defined transformations to every training sample. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to train networks with significantly improved resistance to large variations between training and testing data. This is achieved by embedding a learnable transformation module into the introspective networks (Jin et al., 2017; Lazarow et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018), which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier empowered with generative capabilities. Our approach alternatively synthesizes pseudo-negative samples with learned transformations and enhances the classifier by retraining it with synthesized samples.

Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a recent algorithm which exploits this dynamic response and encourages cooperation in settings like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Although experimentally successful, we show that LOLA can exhibit `arrogant' behaviour directly at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical guarantees applying across all differentiable games. In this paper we present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead.

Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations. While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep batch-normalized networks without residual connections.

We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments. We show that our learned exploration policies can explore better than classical approaches based on geometry alone and generic learning-based exploration techniques.

We show that the distribution mismatch can be eliminated completely by a proper choice of the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. We prove that there is a trade off between the interpolation being linear, and the latent distribution having even the most basic properties required for stable training, such as finite mean.

In the primary visual cortex of mammals, for example, one may observe during development the formation of cells selective to localized, oriented features. This leads to the development of a rough representation of contours of the retinal image in area V1. We modeled these mechanisms using sparse Hebbian learning algorithms. These algorithms alternate a coding step to encode the information with a learning step to find the proper encoder. A major difficulty faced by these algorithms is to deduce a good representation while knowing immature encoders, and to learn good encoders with a non-optimal representation. To address this problem, we propose here to introduce a new regulation process between learning and coding, called homeostasis. Our homeostasis is compatible with a neuro-mimetic architecture and allows for the fast emergence of localized filters sensitive to orientation. The key to this algorithm lies in a simple adaptation mechanism based on non-linear functions that reconciles the antagonistic processes that occur at the coding and learning time scales. We tested this unsupervised algorithm with this homeostasis rule for a range of existing unsupervised learning algorithms coupled with different neural coding algorithms. In addition, we propose a simplification of this optimal homeostasis rule by implementing a simple heuristic on the probability of activation of neurons. Compared to the optimal homeostasis rule, we show that this heuristic allows to implement a more rapid unsupervised learning algorithm while keeping a large part of its effectiveness.

People therefore solve a difficult problem of understanding the salient features of both observations of others and the relationship to their own state when learning to imitate specific tasks. However, we can attempt to reproduce a similar demonstration via trail and error and through this gain more understanding of the task space. To reproduce this ability an agent would need to both learn how to recognize the differences between itself and some demonstration and at the same time learn to minimize the distance between its own performance and that of the demonstration. In this paper we propose an approach using only visual information to learn a distance metric between agent behaviour and a given video demonstration. We train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based Siamese model to compute distances in space and time between motion clips while training an Rienforcement Learning (RL) policy to minimize this distance.

In addition, its adaptive variants tend to produce solutions that generalize less well on unseen data than SGD with a hand-designed schedule. We present an optimization method that offers the best of both worlds: our algorithm yields good generalization performance while requiring only one hyper-parameter. Our approach is based on a composite proximal framework, which exploits the compositional nature of deep neural networks and can leverage powerful convex optimization algorithms by design. Specifically, we employ the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for SVM, which computes an optimal step-size in closed-form at each time-step.

Our algorithm, called Peer-Evaluation based Dual DQN (PED-DQN), proposes to give peer evaluation signals to observed agents, which quantifies how they feel about a certain transition. This exchange of peer evaluation over time turns out to render agents to gradually reshape their reward functions so that their action choices from the myopic best-response tend to result in the good joint action with high cooperation. This evaluation-based method also allows flexible and scalable training by not assuming knowledge of the number of other agents and their observation and action spaces.

This work is mainly focused on the adversarial training with the single-step yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately reflect the adversarial domain. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method by regarding the adversarial training with FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task with limited number of target domain samples.

A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant linear layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. In this paper we provide such a characterization and show that the dimension of invariant and equivariant linear layers between edge-value graph data is 2 and 15, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on k-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the k-th and 2k-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases.\", \"id\": \"Syx72jC9tm.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"A CASE STUDY ON OPTIMAL DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR UAVS\", \"abstract\": \"Over the passage of time Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), especially Autonomous flying drones grabbed a lot of attention in Artificial Intelligence.

In this work, we propose the first zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model1 that can utilize training data in multiple source languages, while not requiring target language training data nor cross-lingual supervision. Unlike existing methods that only rely on language-invariant features for cross-lingual transfer, our approach utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features in a coherent way. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the relation between the target language and each individual source language.

This requires the high-level semantic features should be alike among samples, despite a wide span in resolution, texture, deformation, etc. Previous works focus on re-designing the loss function or proposing new regularization constraints on the loss. In this paper, we address this problem via a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two sets in the feature space: one with more reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training in spirit of student mimicking teacher's behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the high-dimensional space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become more closer within the same category - implying that it is easier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed the spirit into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass. We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is achieved by minimizing the distribution divergence between two sets. We design a historical buffer to represent all previous samples in the reliable set and utilize them to guide the feature learning of the less reliable set. The design of obtaining an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) algorithm into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with the reliable set with aid of OT metric.

We introduce adversarial attacks that instead reprogram the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker--without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack is accomplished by optimizing for a single adversarial perturbation, of unrestricted magnitude, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary when processing these inputs--even if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can be thus considered a program for the new task.

Then, a natural question is: can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process ? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as G. We show that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and prove that the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as G-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in G-space (abbreviated as G-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation.

In this paper, we propose safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on the Lyapunov approach to CMDPs, an approach that has well-established theoretical guarantees in control engineering. We first show how to generate a set of statedependent Lyapunov constraints from the original CMDP safety constraints. We then propose safe policy gradient algorithms that train a neural network policy using DDPG or PPO, while guaranteeing near-constraint satisfaction at every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the linearized Lyapunov constraints. Unlike the existing (safe) constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Furthermore, the action-projection version of our algorithms often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline.

In particular, DN layers constructed from these operations can be interpreted as max-affine spline operators (MASOs) that have an elegant link to vector quantization (VQ) and K-means. While this is good theoretical progress, the entire MASO approach is predicated on the requirement that the nonlinearities be piecewise affine and convex, which precludes important activation functions like the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax. This paper extends the MASO framework to these and an infinitely large class of new nonlinearities by linking deterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).

Specifically, we reformulate the min-max objective in PGD adversarial training by a minimization problem to minimize the original network loss plus l1 norms of its gradients evaluated on the inputs (including adversarial samples). The original loss can be solved by natural training; for the l1-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a differentiable soft-quantization layer after the input layer of a network.

In this work, we revisit this simple strategy and analyze it rigorously, to show that: (a) any stationary point of an 1-regularized layerwisepruning objective has its number of non-zero elements bounded by the number of penalized prediction logits, regardless of the strength of the regularization; (b) successful pruning highly relies on an accurate optimization solver, and there is a trade-off between compression speed and distortion of prediction accuracy, controlled by the strength of regularization. Our theoretical results thus suggest that 1 pruning could be successful provided we use an accurate optimization solver. We corroborate this in our experiments, where we show that simple 1 regularization with an Adamax-L1(cumulative) solver gives pruning ratio competitive to the state-of-the-art.\", \"id\": \"r1exVhActQ.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"PIXEL REDRAWN FOR A ROBUST ADVERSARIAL DEFENSE\", \"abstract\": \"Recently, an adversarial example becomes a serious problem to be aware of because it can fool trained neural networks easily.

The motivation for our PR method is from the observation that the adversarial attacks have redrawn some pixels of the original image with the known parameters of the trained neural network. Mimicking these attacks, our PR method redraws the image without any knowledge of the trained neural network. This method can be similar to the adversarial training method but our PR method can be used to prevent future attacks.

Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the KullbackLeibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family.

In this paper, we aim to investigate on this problem. Similar to internal covariate shift in network forward pass, the distribution changes in weight of top layers also affects training of preceding layers during the backward pass. We call this phenomenon inverse \\\"internal covariate shift\\\". Training hard examples aggravates the distribution shifting and damages the training. To address this problem, we introduce a curriculum loss that consists of two parts: a) an adaptive weight that mitigates large early punishment; b) an additional representation loss for low weighted samples. The intuition of the loss is very simple. We train top layers on \\\"good\\\" samples to reduce large shifting, and encourage \\\"bad\\\" samples to learn from \\\"good\\\" sample. In detail, the adaptive weight assigns small values to hard examples, reducing the influence of noisy gradients. On the other hand, the less-weighted hard sample receives the proposed representation loss. Low-weighted data gets nearly no training signal and can stuck in embedding space for a long time. The proposed representation loss aims to encourage their training. This is done by letting them learn a better representation from its superior neighbours but not participate in learning of top layers. In this way, the fluctuation of top layers is reduced and hard samples also received signals for training.

Although distributed setting is usually adopted by practical systems, local range communication and information aggregation still matter in fulfilling complex tasks. For multi-agent reinforcement learning, many previous studies have been dedicated to design an effective communication architecture. However, existing models usually suffer from an ossified communication structure, e.g., most of them predefine a particular communication mode by specifying a fixed time frequency and spatial scope for agents to communicate regardless of necessity. Such design is incapable of dealing with multi-agent scenarios that are capricious and complicated, especially when only partial information is available. Motivated by this, we argue that the solution is to build a spontaneous and self-organizing communication (SSoC) learning scheme. By treating the communication behaviour as an explicit action, SSoC learns to organize communication in an effective and efficient way. Particularly, it enables each agent to spontaneously decide when and who to send messages based on its observed states. In this way, a dynamic inter-agent communication channel is established in an online and self-organizing manner. The agents also learn how to adaptively aggregate the received messages and its own hidden states to execute actions. Various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that SSoC really learns intelligent message passing among agents located far apart. With such agile communications, we observe that effective collaboration tactics emerge which have not been mastered by the compared baselines.\", \"id\": \"rJ4vlh0qtm.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"AN ATTENTION-BASED MODEL FOR LEARNING DYNAMIC INTERACTION NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"While machine learning models achieve human-comparable performance on sequential data, exploiting structured knowledge is still a challenging problem.

As a byproduct, we analyze the true benefit of these hypergradient methods compared to more classical schedules, such as the fixed decay of Wilson et al. (2017). In particular, we observe they are of marginal help since their performance varies significantly when tuning their hyperparameters.

In this setting many classical tools from approximation theory can be effectively used. However, in typical applications we expect data to be high dimensional, but structured � so, it would only be important to approximate the desired function well on the relevant part of its domain, e.g. a small manifold on which real input data actually lies. Moreover, even within this domain the desired quality of approximation may not be uniform; for instance in classification problems, the approximation needs to be more accurate near the decision boundary. These issues, to the best of our knowledge, have remain unexplored until now. With this in mind, we analyze the performance of neural networks and polynomial kernels in a natural regression setting where the data enjoys sparse latent structure, and the labels depend in a simple way on the latent variables. We give an almost-tight theoretical analysis of the performance of both neural networks and polynomials for this problem, as well as verify our theory with simulations.

On one hand, the aforementioned challenges require a rigorous mathematical analysis capable of dealing with high-dimensional heterogeneous data streams. On the other hand, this rigorous mathematical framework allows us to learn precise, compact information and be able to coherently propagate measures of uncertainty across spatiotemporal states. To efficiently and rigorously process high-dimensional data coming from complex systems, we advocate for an information theory inspired approach that incorporates stochastic calculus and seeks to determine a trade-off between the predictive accuracy and compactness of the mathematical representation. Mathematically, such a model construction is cast as an optimization problem that maximizes the compression such that the predictive ability and correlation (relatedness) constraints between the original data and compact model are closely bounded. To learn this compact representation of a time-varying complex system and solve the above-mentioned optimization problem we use variational calculus and derive its general solution expressions. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees concerning the convergence of the proposed algorithm. To further test the proposed framework, we consider a high-dimensional Gaussian case study and describe an iterative scheme for updating the new model parameters. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits on compression and prediction accuracy for a class of dynamical systems.

But the increased memory footprint of these models presents a challenge during training, when all intermediate layer activations need to be stored for back-propagation. Limited GPU memory forces practitioners to make sub-optimal choices: either train inefficiently with smaller batches of examples; or limit the architecture to have lower depth and width, and fewer layers at higher spatial resolutions. This work introduces an approximation strategy that significantly reduces a network's memory footprint during training, but has negligible effect on training performance and computational expense. During the forward pass, we replace activations with lower-precision approximations immediately after they have been used by subsequent layers, thus freeing up memory. The approximate activations are then used during the backward pass. This approach limits the accumulation of errors across the forward and backward pass--because the forward computation across the network still happens at full precision, and the approximation has a limited effect when computing gradients to a layer's input. Experiments, on CIFAR and ImageNet, show that using our approach with 8- and even 4-bit fixed-point approximations of 32-bit floating-point activations has only a minor effect on training and validation performance, while affording significant savings in memory usage.\", \"id\": \"rJgfjjC9Ym.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"ON INDUCTIVE BIASES IN DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\", \"abstract\": \"Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms contain inductive biases that sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment.

Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms that work on a wider class of problems. This trade-off is relevant because these inductive biases are not free; substantial effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that modify the agent's objective and environmental interface. We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when all these fixed components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature. In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better. We then investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system.

Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim's entire network architecture.

A well-known tool for performing state estimation under these conditions is the Kalman filter (Kalman et al., 1960). However, the Kalman filter is limited to problems with known, linear models and good estimates about the system noise. Recent deep learning approaches integrate a nonlinear encoder into the KF equations that maps the high-dimensional observation to the typically low-dimensional state of the system (Haarnoja et al., 2016). However, these approaches are still limited to systems with known dynamics that are either linear or it requires approximations such as an extended Kalman filter. In contrast, our approach does not use a pre-defined state representation but learns a high-dimensional factorized representation that is used for inference using locally linear models. While our locally linear modelling and factorization assumptions are in general not true for the original low-dimensional state space of the system, the network finds a high-dimensional latent space where these assumptions hold to perform efficient inference.

We argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a robust MDP framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent's reward. For a challenging network scheduling domain, we find that AGZ within the robust MDP framework provides near-optimal performance, matching one of the best known scheduling policies that has taken the networking community three decades of intensive research to develop.\", \"id\": \"rkxtl3C5YX.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"LEARNING MODELS FOR VISUAL 3D LOCALIZATION\", \"abstract\": \"We consider learning based methods for visual localization that do not require the construction of explicit maps in the form of point clouds or voxels.

To study this approach we consider procedurally generated Minecraft worlds, for which we can generate images of complex 3D scenes along with camera pose coordinates.

In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the gradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable per-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average their minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used to update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents stragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers can complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time performance.

Methods for object localization, however, are still in need of substantial improvement. Common approaches to this problem involve the use of a sliding window, sometimes at multiple scales, providing input to a deep CNN trained to classify the contents of the window. In general, these approaches are time consuming, requiring many classification calculations. In this paper, we offer a fundamentally different approach to the localization of recognized objects in images. Our method is predicated on the idea that a deep CNN capable of recognizing an object must implicitly contain knowledge about object location in its connection weights. We provide a simple method to interpret classifier weights in the context of individual classified images. This method involves the calculation of the derivative of network generated activation patterns, such as the activation of output class label units, with regard to each input pixel, performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the pixels that, in a local sense, have the greatest influence on internal representations and object recognition. These derivatives can be efficiently computed using a single backward pass through the deep CNN classifier, producing a sensitivity map of the image. We demonstrate that a simple linear mapping can be learned from sensitivity maps to bounding box coordinates, localizing the recognized object.

In this paper, we propose to exploit the object-level relation to learn the image relation feature, which is converted into a distance directly. For a new category, even though its images are not seen by the model, some objects may appear in the training images. Hence, object-level relation is useful for inferring the relation of images from unseen categories. Consequently, our model generalizes well for new categories without fine-tuning.

Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TGSAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS).

One popular way to superficially resolve this issue is to separate a pipeline into a set of differentiable sub-pipelines and train them with isolated loss functions.

In recent years various methods for NE have been introduced, all following a similar strategy: defining a notion of similarity between nodes (typically some distance measure within the network), a distance measure in the embedding space, and a loss function that penalizes large distances for similar nodes and small distances for dissimilar nodes. A difficulty faced by existing methods is that certain networks are fundamentally hard to embed due to their structural properties: (approximate) multipartiteness, certain degree distributions, assortativity, etc. To overcome this, we introduce a conceptual innovation to the NE literature and propose to create Conditional Network Embeddings (CNEs); embeddings that maximally add information with respect to given structural properties (e.g. node degrees, block densities, etc.). We use a simple Bayesian approach to achieve this, and propose a block stochastic gradient descent algorithm for fitting it efficiently.

In this work, we analytically and empirically investigate the popular characteristics of learned representations, including correlation, sparsity, dead unit, rank, and mutual information, and disprove many of the conventional wisdom. We first show that infinitely many Identical Output Networks (IONs) can be constructed for any deep network with a linear layer, where any invertible affine transformation can be applied to alter the layer's representation characteristics. The existence of ION proves that the correlation characteristics of representation can be either low or high for a well-performing network. Extensions to ReLU layers are provided, too. Then, we consider sparsity, dead unit, and rank to show that only loose relationships exist among the three characteristics. It is shown that a higher sparsity or additional dead units do not imply a better or worse performance when the rank of representation is fixed. We also develop a rank regularizer and show that neither representation sparsity nor lower rank is helpful for improving performance even when the data-generation process has only a small number of independent factors. Mutual information I(zl; x) and I(zl; y) are investigated as well, and we show that regularizers can affect I(zl; x) and thus indirectly influence the performance.

Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient descent.

A promising, low-cost, and time-efficient biotechnology for localizing proteins is high-throughput fluorescence microscopy imaging (HTI). This imaging technique stains the protein of interest in a cell with fluorescent antibodies and subsequently takes a microscopic image. Together with images of other stained proteins or cell organelles and the annotation by the Human Protein Atlas project, these images provide a rich source of information on the protein location which can be utilized by computational methods. It is yet unclear how precise such methods are and whether they can compete with human experts.

In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as \\\"posterior collapse\\\" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate to the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse results. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work.

However, existing techniques either fail to guarantee a Lipschitz constraint or are unable to universally approximate Lipschitz functions. Often, a small Lipschitz constant is enforced by considering constraints on the network weights, but little attention is payed to the choice of activation function. We identify Jacobian norm of network layers as a scarce resource in representing Lipschitz functions and show that common activation functions are unable to effectively utilize this. We show that with common activation functions networks are unable to learn even the simplest Lipschitz functions, such as the absolute value function. With this insight, we introduce a novel activation function, the GroupSort activation, which partitions the hidden layer and sorts the units within each partition. Empirically, we identify pathologies of common activation functions and confirm that these theoretical observations are relevant in practice. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in training neural networks which have a Lipschitz property. The Lipschitz property ensures that a small change in the network input can only produce a small change in its output, as decided by a Lipschitz constant. For classification, one can show that a small Lipschitz constant leads to better generalization, improved adversarial robustness, and greater interpretability (Sokolic� et al., 2017; Tsipras et al., 2018). The need for such networks extends beyond classification. Computing the Wasserstein distance -- a principled way of computing the distance between two probability distributions -- can be rewritten in its dual form as a search over Lipschitz functions. The WGAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017) uses this formulation in its training objective and the question of how to optimize over Lipschitz functions has played a major role in the development of these techniques (Gulrajani et al., 2017; Gemici et al., 2018). Despite this interest, the question of how to restrict neural networks to be Lipschitz functions remains largely unanswered. A common approach adds a gradient penalty to the loss function (Drucker & Le Cun, 1992; Gulrajani et al., 2017). Although this method seems to work well in practice it does not provide guarantees on the Lipschitz constant. Other approaches, so called atomic constructions, directly restrict the architecture by placing limitations on the Lp norm (such as the matrix spectral norm) of each layer's weight matrix (Cisse et al., 2017; Yoshida & Miyato, 2017). Outside of practical limitations, these techniques can guarantee a small Lipschitz constant but they raise a new question: how restrictive are these weight constraints? Unfortunately, it turns out that these networks are typically unable to universally approximate Lipschitz functions (Huster et al., 2018). In this work, we provide concrete answers to the question of universal approximation of Lipschitz functions. We further study the issues raised in Huster et al. (2018) and expand their negative results for additional norms and activation functions. In doing so, we identify that for an atomic construction to have the expressiveness to represent a large class of Lipschitz function, it must use Jacobian norm preserving layers. That is, the Jacobian of each linear transformation and activation should not allow the reduction of Jacobian of the entire neural network. Our primary contributions are as follows. We identify Jacobian norm preservation as an important design principle in building universal Lipschitz function approximators and introduce the novel GroupSort activation as a general means to achieve this. We demonstrate that using common activations such as ReLU within Lipschitz constrained networks leads to pathologies in the learned networks but show that these issues are resolved by GroupSort.

Therefore, we propose a method, Stochastic Quantized Activation (SQA) that solves overfitting problems in single-step adversarial training and fastly achieves the robustness comparable to the multi-step. SQA attenuates the adversarial effects by providing random selectivity to activation functions and allows the network to learn robustness with only single-step training. Throughout the experiment, our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art robustness against one of the strongest white-box attacks as PGD training, but with much less computational cost. Finally, we visualize the learning process of the network with SQA to handle strong adversaries, which is different from existing methods.\", \"id\": \"ryxeB30cYX.txt\" }, { \"title\": \"ANTISYMMETRICRNN: A DYNAMICAL SYSTEM VIEW ON RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS\", \"abstract\": \"Recurrent neural networks have gained widespread use in modeling sequential data.

In comparison to existing approaches for improving RNN trainability, which often incur significant computation overhead, AntisymmetricRNN achieves the same goal by design. We showcase the advantage of this new architecture through extensive simulations and experiments. AntisymmetricRNN exhibits much more predictable dynamics.

A novel learningbased approach is proposed to prune filters in our main/subsidiary network framework, where the main network is responsible for learning representative features to optimize the prediction performance, and the subsidiary component works as a filter selector on the main network. To avoid gradient mismatch when training the subsidiary component, we propose a layer-wise and bottom-up scheme. We also provide the theoretical and experimental comparison between our learning-based and greedy rule-based methods. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach applied on several binary models, including binarized NIN, VGG-11, and ResNet-18, on various image classification datasets.

The encoder encodes dialogue history, modifies global contextual representation that is shared with the decoder, and generates a global memory pointer. The decoder first generates a sketch response with unfilled slots. Next, it passes the global memory pointer to filter the external knowledge for relevant information, then instantiates the slots via the local memory pointers which points to specific entries in the external knowledge.
